Game play is as follows: The player character moves through a dungeon and slays enemies and collects treasure until reaching the end of the dungeon (where the end of the dungeon is the 5th floor). A dungeon consists of different floors which consist of chambers connected with passages. In our simplification, each floor will always consist of the same 5 chambers connected in the exact same way. CC3k+differs from other rogue-likes in a significant way: it is does not update the terminal/window in real-time but rather redraws all elements every turn (e.g. after every command). Although, many early rogue-likes were programmed in a similar fashion to CC3k+.", "", 2022-08-02 00:59:58 +0000 UTC
