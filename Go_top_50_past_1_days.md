| 1 | [SRN_Letters](https://github.com/Tayloraki/SRN_Letters) | This project uses a simple recurrent network (SRN) to learn and predict sequences. It was built for my Neural Network Models of Social and Cognitive Processes course and forks off a template provided to me by Professor Stephen J. Read. The purpose of this program is (for example) given the input 'ABCB', the system would output 'D'. This requires the system to discern between the 'context' of A-B->C and C-B->D. This program takes this simple premise and extends into second order dependencies. | 2022-10-07 00:45:08 +0000 UTC |
