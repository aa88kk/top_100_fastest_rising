There is no doubt that fault-tolerance and availability are the major concerns when a modern system is designed. The ability to keep your business 24/7 available when it is scaled up is the most crucial part of nowadays applications. In this project we have developed a reliable and fault-tolerant key-value database using Raft consensus algorithm. The project was implemented according to Raft extended paper. Since we didn't have enough servers to implement such distributed algorithms, we borowed the network simulator, created by MIT, to simulate unstable network and servers. We used the MIT's lab code as a code base and we implemented on top that the Raft algorithm. | 2021-10-28 20:23:10 +0000 UTC |
